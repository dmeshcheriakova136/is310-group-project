# Mass Digitization & Digital Libraries Group Assignment

## Part 1






## Part 2 


1. For our group topic of History & Politicis the digital representations are scanned and digitized newspapers, books, reports, versions of consitution, and legal documentation. Every historical physical material might be digitized for more broad user access. For the digital objects in history and politics, there are video footage, scanned photos, and audio files. These digital objects and representations are related to our topic of history and politics because they provide a detailed text description (e.g., scanned and digitized constitution that describes legal procedures) and a visual presentation of the history (photos, videos).
2. **Digitization Process:** Many of the records for our topic are digitized using OCR processes. Since we're dealing primarily with historical data many records we're looking at were created before digital processes were an option. OCR is a convenient standard since it makes the documents searchable in addition to being just digital.

4. In the History and Politics area, there might be several examples of born-digital materials. Those include spreadsheets and databases taken from current historical and political data on any topic, posts on social media by political figures, and digitally created videos and photos. Governmental websites might not be fuly digitized either. Examples: historical and political video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpldEyE-LcI). website Report (https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/politics/g32746486/white-house-protests-history-photos/). In comparison with digitized materials, digitally born materials represent more modern history and politics. In addition to that, they are more accessible to the wider audience and don't loose the quality or fade away over time.
5. Based on the Claude AI Research, the oldest digital library related to history and politics is Project Gutenberg in 1971. It's the first online library that reaches over 75,000 materials. Fun fact, it was created by the alumni of Univierity of Urbana-Champaign - writer Michael S. Heart. The base first material that established this e-book library was U.S. Declaration of Independence. Besides that, the library contains a lot of American history and politcs books from different years. The website: (https://gutenberg.org/)
6. Based on the Claude AI Research, the newest digital material related to my topic is 'Recollection: A Civil Rights Legal Archive,' It was launched on October 17, 2024 by the Legal Defense Fund's Thurgood Marshall Institute. Basically, it collection of biographies: videos, digital born articles which include digitizes documents. One of the main differences between the oldest archive and the newest is how modern the web-site looks. The newest digital archive is able to handle storage of video files, have animations, and sotring and search function for the stories. For the older library, it's mostly text-based material.

7. One of the examples of historical & political object has gone viral recently are Epstein Files release topic. This topic went viral on different digital channels: news, social media, youtube channels. This viral theme also contributed to the creation of a lot of digitally born materials, memes for example. The moment led to the creation of a lot of born-digital memes on the internet.
